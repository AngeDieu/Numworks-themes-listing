### Installation
To use this theme, add `THEME_NAME` and `THEME_REPO` arguments to your `make` command:
```bash
$ make THEME_NAME=arc_dark THEME_REPO="https://github.com/lolocomotive/Omega-Arc-Dark"
```
_Notice: I made some tweaks to the operating system itself to be able to modify certain colors, if you want to be sure that it works, clone [my Upsilon fork](https://github.com/lolocomotive/Upsilon) instead of any other operating system._
